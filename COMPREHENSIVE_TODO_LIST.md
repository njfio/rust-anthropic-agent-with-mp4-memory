3. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Different modules handle errors differently
4. **No Dependency Injection**: Hard to mock dependencies for testing
5. **Monolithic Design**: Large files with multiple responsibilities

### Recommended Refactoring:
1. **Extract Interfaces**: Create traits for `MemoryStorage`, `ApiClient`, `ToolExecutor`
2. **Implement Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access behind repositories
3. **Add Service Layer**: Separate business logic from infrastructure concerns
4. **Use Builder Pattern**: For complex object construction
5. **Implement Event System**: For loose coupling between components
