Hello! This is a test prompt loaded from a file.

Please tell me:
1. What model are you using?
2. What are your current capabilities?
3. Can you confirm that you're running the enhanced rust_memvid_agent with the new input system?

This demonstrates the file input mode where complex, multi-line prompts can be prepared in advance and loaded into the agent.

Thank you!
