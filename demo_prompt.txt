ðŸŽ¯ ENHANCED INPUT SYSTEM DEMONSTRATION

Hello! This is a demonstration of the new file input mode for rust_memvid_agent.

## Test Objectives:
1. Verify file input mode functionality
2. Test multi-line prompt processing
3. Confirm agent capabilities and model information
4. Validate memory system integration

## Questions:
1. What model are you currently using?
2. Can you confirm the enhanced input system is working?
3. What are your key capabilities as MemVidAgent?
4. How does the file input mode improve workflow efficiency?

## Expected Results:
- Successful file loading and processing
- Accurate model identification (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
- Comprehensive capability overview
- Confirmation of enhanced input system functionality

This demonstrates how complex, structured prompts can be prepared in advance and loaded seamlessly into the agent for processing.

Thank you for testing the enhanced input system! ðŸš€
